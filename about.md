I am currently pursuing my PhD in [Materials Science & Engineering](https://www.mse.ucla.edu/) at UCLA studying battery materials under [Professor Bruce Dunn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EbwiqDkAAAAJ&hl=en) working on several different ongoing projects:

1) Understanding the fundamental Lithium plating and stripping process in protective layers for Lithium metal anodes

2) Studying the influence microstructure on electrochemical performance of iongels(a composite pseudosolid consisting of salts that are liquid at room temperature confined in a solid silica matrix electrolytes which behave like solids macroscopically but liquids microscopically)

3) Translating photolithographic cleanroom technologies to fabricate an solid state photopatternable battery for on-chip applications


### More Information

Beyond work, I find enjoyment in learning and try out new things
Some stuff I find interest in:

-Gardening (My plants can prevail against the I-405 Freeway Dust)

-Climbing (Indoor bouldering and lead climbing)

-Homebrewing (I'm a big fan of brown ales)

-Knittting (Trying to work towards my life long dream of being able to knit my own socks)

-Soap Making (Sometimes I like to do practical experiments at home)

-Podcasts (NPR's Up First, The Daily, Ologies, Planet Money)

-Reading (I like short stories)

-Creating digital artwork (See Main Page)

-Cooking (Can't say I'm great at cooking but it's a work in progress)

-Listening to Music (Lianne La Havas, Vampire Weekend, The National, Jordan Rakei, FKJ, Rhye, Khruangbin, Cigarettes After Sex, Bombay Bicycle Club, James Vincent McMorrow, Amason(Swedish Group), City of the Sun(Guitar instrumentals), Sufjan Stevens, Tame Impala, Arcade Fire, Blind Pilot, City and Color, Gregory Alan Isakov, Miles Davis, Maribou State, The Shins, Real Estate, The War on Drugs, Alabama Shakes, Anderson Peak, Beach House, Beirut, Koffee, Palace)

-Driving around LA during non-traffic hours
