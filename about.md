I am currently pursuing my PhD in Materials Science & Engineering at UCLA studying battery materials. Several different ongoing projects:

1) Understanding the fundamental plating and stripping process in protective layers for Lithium metal anodes

2) Studying the influence microstructure on electrochemical performance of iongels(a composite pseudosolid consisting of salts that are liquid at room temperature confined in a solid silica matrix electrolytes which behave like solids macroscopically but liquids microscopically)

3) Translating photolithographic cleanroom technologies to fabricate an solid state photopatternable battery for on-chip applications


### More Information

Beyond work, I find enjoyment in learning and try out new things
Some stuff I find interest in:
-Gardening (My plants can prevail against the I-405 Freeway Dust)
-Climbing (Indoor bouldering and lead climbing)
-Homebrewing (I'm a big fan of brown ales)
-Knittting (Trying to work towards my life long dream of being able to knit my own socks)
-Soap Making (Sometimes I like to do practical experiments at home)
-Podcasts (NPR's Up First, The Daily, Ologies, Planet Money)
-Reading(I like short stories)
-Cooking (Can't say I'm great at cooking but it's a work in progress)
-Driving around LA during non-traffic hours
