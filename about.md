### Things I enjoy (aka things that I can eat, drink, wear, use, listen to, etc)

* Gardening (a variety of fruits, vegetables, indoor plants)
  Current favorite plants: dragonfruit tree & jacaranda tree

* Climbing (indoor bouldering and lead climbing)

* Homebrewing (a fan of brown ales)
  I brew primarily in 1 gallon batches and more recently started experimenting with wet hopping using some home grown Cascade Hops.
  
* Knittting 
  Finally got to knit my grandma a pair of socks :)

* Soap Making 
  Pretty practical hobby if you ask me

* Podcasts
  Here are a few I enjoy!: NPR's Up First, The Daily, Ologies, Planet Money, The Shrink Next Door, S-Town
  
* Reading 
  Murakami short stories are the perfect mixture of engaging, weird, and thought provoking
  
* Creating digital artwork (see Art Page)
