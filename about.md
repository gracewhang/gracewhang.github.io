I am currently pursuing my PhD in [Materials Science & Engineering](https://www.mse.ucla.edu/) at UCLA studying battery materials under [Professor Bruce Dunn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EbwiqDkAAAAJ&hl=en) working on several different ongoing projects:

### 1) Understanding the fundamental Lithium plating and stripping process in protective layers for Lithium metal anodes

Lithium metal has long been considered the anode of choice for next-generation high energy density batteries due to its low standard reduction potential (-3.04 V vs. SHE) and high specific capacity (3860 mAh g-1) (These are the two key factors that determine Energy Density- how much charge you can store per weight). Per mass, it can store 10 times the amount of charge per weight that the commercial graphite anode can. However, the formation of lithium dendrites(finger like structures that can travel across the electrolyte and sometimes touch the cathode resulting in short circuit--> high current that runs through flammable electrolyte= a bad time) upon repeated plating and stripping(charging and discharging) persistently remains as the greatest opposition to its implementation in commercial devices. In order to address the problem, the interface, a critical region where breakdown and decomposition often occurs, must be properly understood and stabilized. The use of interfacial layers have been found to show promise in suppressing dendrite formation but the fundamental mechanism is less understood and agreed upon. 


### 2) Studying the influence microstructure on electrochemical performance of ionogel electrolytes. 

Ionogels are a class of pseudosolids. They are are composite of two phases: 1) a room temperature molten salt(think liquid soup consisting of just ions) which is confined in 2) a solid silica matrix (think porous glass with pore sizes in the nanoscale). They behave like solids at the macroscale and like liquids at the nanoscale, which is beneficial since ion movement in liquids is generally faster than in solids. The future of battery technology is shifted towards an all solid state system, removing the need to use flammable liquid electrolytes. Ionogels are generally non-flammable due to the fact that ionic liquids have negligible vapor pressure. Additionally, the ionic liquid stays confined inside the host silica matrix through capillary forces and thus do not evaporate either which make them an interesting class of materials to study. Additionally, there is growing interest in the use of ionogels in low temperature applications(space perhaps?) due to the low freezing point which can further be lowered by mixing of different salts(entropy effect-) and also due the confinement effects of being encapsulated in a silica matrix.

### 3) Translating photolithographic cleanroom technologies to fabricate a solid state photopatternable battery for on-chip applications

The invention of a transistor relies heavily on photolithographic processes which use UV-light(wavelength typically around 200-300nm) to chemically change light-sensitive materials in certain regions to create a designated pattern with nanoscale features. Silicon, which is the bread and butter of most traditional semiconductor technology just so happens to also be a material that is widely studied as a potential contender for next generation battery anodes. The ability to pattern and create 3 dimensional architectures for battery materials opens the door for a wide variety of on-chip battery and high power applications due to the increase surface area that 3D architectures offer over traditional planar designs.
