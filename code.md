I'd like to use this space to share simple programs I write for random personal and research related projects I work on from time to time. I primarily use MATLAB but am hoping to also include codes written for Python and Processing. Stay tuned~



## Tomato Code
Here is a [link](https://github.com/gracewhang/tomato_code) to the tomato_code repository.

This image processing script can take any .jpg image, transform it to grayscale, and threshold your image to varying levels (in version 1, its 3 levels). For version 2, I'd like to give the user the ability to designate how many grayscale values they want to allow the image to have and also add the possibility of choosing colors to replace the grayscale values. But for now, here it is, plain and simple :)
