<center>Spicy Butternut Squash Pasta with Spinach</center>
<br>
First time cooking with butternut squash- came out pretty good too. The recipe I followed was from The [New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021535-spicy-butternut-squash-pasta-with-spinach). Instead of ground cumin, I substituted it with whole cumin seeds and because I like cumin seeds a lot, I doubled the amount to two tablespoons. For next time, I'd probably add more salt along the way and add some sliced pickled jalapeños right before baking the dish (I just used raw jalapeños this time) to help the flavor.
