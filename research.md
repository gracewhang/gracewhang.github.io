I am currently pursuing my PhD in [Materials Science & Engineering](https://www.mse.ucla.edu/) at UCLA studying battery materials under [Professor Bruce Dunn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EbwiqDkAAAAJ&hl=en) working on several different ongoing projects:

### 1) Understanding the mechanism of lithium plating underneath coatings as an approach to circumventing lithium dendrites

![Image description](/images/Picture1.png)
Lithium metal has long been considered the anode of choice for next-generation high energy density batteries due to its low standard reduction potential (-3.04 V vs. SHE) and high specific capacity (3860 mAh g-1, ten times that of commercially used graphite). However, the formation of lithium dendrites finger like structures, which continue to grow upon upon repeated plating and stripping and often result in short circuiting(lithium dendrites touch the cathode resulting in high current flow inside the battery contained in flammable electrolyte) persistently remains as the greatest opposition to its implementation in commercial devices. In order to address the problem, the interface, a critical region where breakdown and decomposition often occurs, must be properly understood and stabilized. The use of coating layers on the lithium surface have been found to show promise in suppressing dendrite formation to some degree but the mechansims at play are still less agreed upon. While most lithium coatings result in plating on top of the coating layer with improved morphology of lithium deposits, less studied is the case where the lithium can be transported through the layer and deposited underneath. The ability to understand the mechanism of plating underneath is both of fundamental and practical interest in better understanding the critical parameters to drive lithium transport through a layer and the ability to apply design principles to create a layer that can supress lithium dendrite growth.

<br> I presented at the [Materials Research Fall 2020 Conference at symposium EN03](https://www.mrs.org/meetings-events/fall-meetings-exhibits/2020-mrs-spring-and-fall-meeting/call-for-papers/call-for-papers-detail?code=F.EN03) (Overcoming the Challenges with Metal Anodes for High-Energy Batteries) and my talk was presented with a "Best Presentation Award." Here's a link to my [abstract](link).

### 2) Studying the influence microstructure on electrochemical performance of ionogel electrolytes. 

Ionogels are a class of pseudosolids. They are a composite of two phases: 1) a room temperature molten salt(think liquid soup consisting of just ions) which is confined in 2) a solid silica matrix (think porous glass with pore sizes in the nanoscale). Ionogels behave like solids at the macroscale and like liquids at the nanoscale, resulting in faster ion movement(ions in liquids are generally faster than in solids), while imparting the beneficial mechanical properties of a solid. The future of battery technology has shifted towards an all solid state system, removing the need to use flammable liquid electrolytes. Ionogels are generally non-flammable due to their negligible vapor pressure which make them promising candidates from a safety standpoint. In addition to the fact that the ionic liquid does not evaporate out of the silica matrix, it also stays confined inside the host silica matrix through capillary forces which make them an interesting class of materials to study for more reasons than one. Lastly, there is a growing interest in the use of ionogels in low temperature applications(space perhaps?) due to the low freezing point which can further be lowered by mixing of different salts(entropy effect) and also due the confinement effects from the nanoporpous silica matrix.

<br>I don't have any published work on this project but if you're interested in ionogels, I'd highly recommend this [paper](https://www.cell.com/joule/pdfExtended/S2542-4351(17)30037-5) published in Joule from our group.

### 3) Translating photolithographic cleanroom technologies to fabricate a solid state photopatternable battery for on-chip applications

Transistor technology heavily relies upon on photolithographic processes which use UV-light(wavelength typically around 200-300nm) to chemically change light-sensitive materials in certain regions to create a designated pattern with nanoscale features. Silicon, which is the bread and butter of most traditional semiconductor technology just so happens to also be a material that is widely studied as a potential contender for next generation battery anodes. The ability to pattern and create 3 dimensional architectures for battery materials opens the door for a wide variety of on-chip battery and high power applications due to the increase surface area that 3D architectures offer over traditional planar designs.

<br>If you're interested in this work, I'd check out this [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201703772) published in Advanced Materials from our group.
