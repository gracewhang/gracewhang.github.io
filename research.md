I'm a PhD student in [Materials Science & Engineering](https://www.mse.ucla.edu/) at UCLA studying battery materials under [Professor Bruce Dunn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EbwiqDkAAAAJ&hl=en) working on a variety of projects:

### 1) Understanding the mechanism of lithium plating underneath coatings as an approach to circumventing lithium dendrites




Lithium metal has long been considered the anode of choice for next-generation high energy density batteries due to its low standard reduction potential (-3.04 V vs. SHE) and high specific capacity (3860 mAh g-1, ten times that of commercially used graphite) which ultimately provides a high energy density (energy density depends on both the specific capacity and the voltage window of operation- for an anode, we want a material that has a low redox potential, such that when paired with a high voltage cathode, we can have large voltage window of operation). For the commerically used graphite anode, Li-ions are shuttled in and out of the layers of graphite, resulting in no structural changes (a topotactic reaction) to the graphite host other than some slight volume expansion ~10%; however, for a lithium metal anode, the reaction mechanism for charge storage occurs through plating/stripping where Li ions are reduced to Li (neutral) and vice versa in the oxidative process. Therefore, in this kind of system, it is possible to have an "anodeless" battery design with just a current collector in which lithium from the cathode can be removed and plated onto the anode current collector. Seems too good to be true right? Well, turns out it sort of is. 
<br>
The challenge of using a lithium metal anode stems from safety concerns in addition to long term stability/performance (Low Coulombic Efficiency and Dead Lithium). Both concerns can more or less be pin pointed at the formation of "lithium dendrites," that is, finger-like and branch like lithium deposits that form and grow upon repeated plating and stripping cycles. Lithium dendrites have been found to puncture through separators and reach the cathode, resulting in a short circuit (large currents, high heat, flammable electrolyte= big safety issue). In order to address the problem, the interface, a critical region where breakdown and decomposition often occurs, must be properly understood and stabilized. 

<br>
The use of coating layers on the lithium surface have been found to show promise in suppressing dendrite formation to some degree by tuning the morphology of the plated lithium. However, while most lithium coatings result in plating on top of the coating whereby the coating serves as a nucleation substrate,  less studied is the case where the lithium can be transported through the layer and deposited underneath. The basic idea is that by confining lithium deposition to take place underneath the coating, we can effectively suppress lithium dendrite formation at the surface. The ability to understand the mechanism of plating underneath is both of fundamental and practical interest in better understanding the critical parameters to drive lithium transport through a layer and the ability to apply design principles to create a layer that can supress lithium dendrite growth.

Here's a link to a Perspective my collaborator Qizhang and I helped write in [Applied Physics Letters](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0018417) about interface engineering of the challenging lithium metal interface and our two cents on where we see the field going.

<br> I presented at the [Materials Research Society (MRS) Fall 2020 Conference at symposium EN03](https://www.mrs.org/meetings-events/fall-meetings-exhibits/2020-mrs-spring-and-fall-meeting/call-for-papers/call-for-papers-detail?code=F.EN03) (Overcoming the Challenges with Metal Anodes for High-Energy Batteries) and my talk was presented with a "Best Presentation Award." Here's a link to my [abstract](link).

### 2) Studying the influence microstructure on electrochemical performance of ionogel electrolytes. 

Ionogels are a class of pseudosolids. They are a composite of two phases: 1) a room temperature molten salt(think liquid soup consisting of just ions) which is confined in 2) a solid silica matrix (think porous glass with pore sizes in the nanoscale). Ionogels behave like solids at the macroscale and like liquids at the nanoscale, resulting in faster ion movement(ions in liquids are generally faster than in solids), while imparting the beneficial mechanical properties of a solid. Solid state electrolytes often suffer from high resistances formed at the solid/solid interface. With an ionogel, we can circumvent this problem of high interfacial resistance due to the formation of solid/liquid interfaces from the ionic liquid. The future of battery technology has shifted towards an all solid state system, removing the need to use flammable liquid electrolytes. Ionogels are generally non-flammable due to their negligible vapor pressure which make them promising candidates from a safety standpoint. In addition to the fact that the ionic liquid does not evaporate out of the silica matrix, it also stays confined inside the host silica matrix through capillary forces which make them an interesting class of materials to study for more reasons than one. Lastly, there is a growing interest in the use of ionogels in low temperature applications(space perhaps?) due to the low freezing point which can further be lowered by mixing of different salts(entropy effect) and also due the confinement effects from the nanoporpous silica matrix.

<br>I don't have any published work on this project but if you're interested in ionogels, I'd highly recommend this [paper](https://www.cell.com/joule/pdfExtended/S2542-4351(17)30037-5) published in Joule from our group.

### 3) Translating photolithographic cleanroom technologies to fabricate a solid state photopatternable battery for on-chip applications

Transistor technology heavily relies upon on photolithographic processes which use UV-light(wavelength typically around 200-300nm) to chemically change light-sensitive materials in certain regions to create a designated pattern with nanoscale features. Silicon, which is the bread and butter of most traditional semiconductor technology just so happens to also be a material that is widely studied as a potential contender for next generation battery anodes. The ability to pattern and create 3 dimensional architectures for battery materials opens the door for a wide variety of on-chip battery and high power applications due to the increase surface area that 3D architectures offer over traditional planar designs.

<br>If you're interested in this work, I'd check out this [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201703772) published in Advanced Materials from our group.
